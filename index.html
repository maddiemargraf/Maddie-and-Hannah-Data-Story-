      <h1>Not All Schools Are the Same: Who Gets School-Based Health Centers—and Who Doesn’t?</h1>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>

         

          <p style= "text-indent:40px;">Access to school-based health centers (SBHCs) isn’t distributed evenly across schools, and that raises important questions about fairness in student health and wellbeing. The data we present explores how schools with and without SBHCs differ across key factors such as size, type, and grade level. Do larger schools have greater access to these critical health resources than smaller ones? Are traditional public schools more likely to host SBHCs than charter or technical schools? And how does access shift between elementary, middle, and secondary schools? By examining these patterns, we can better understand which students are most likely- and least likely- to have essential health services available right where they learn./p>
          
<p style= "text-indent:40px;">Our community partners want to gauge what types of schools SBHCs are located in and how many students those schools serve across each grade level. These are important factors for our community partner to know because they want to know where SBHCs are distributed across the state of Connecticut. Our partner wants to learn these factors so that SBHCs can be distributed fairly and be a resource to children who need it. 
So far we have found that the majority of schools with SBHCs in Connecticut are public schools. We found that there is a significant difference in the number of public schools with SBHC’s than any other school type. This shows that there is limited access to SBHC’s across school types. Though one may be able to infer that public schools having access to SBHC’s is a positive because this gives health care access to a larger population, across the board there is limited access to SBHC in relation to school type.</p> 
            
 <p>Research Questions: 
How do schools with and without SBHCs vary by demographics and resources such as:
Total student enrollment (large, medium, small schools)?
School type (traditional public, charter, technical, etc.)?</p>

          <h2>Findings: Wide Variations Across School Types With SBHC</h2>

          <p>TELL your story and SHOW your evidence. When describing charts, maps, or tables that appear further below, refer to them "...as shown in Figure 1" or "...as shown in Table 1" and include those figure/table numbers in the titles or captions below.</p>

          <p>Embed each of your published visualizations as an HTML iframe code, following instructions in <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/embed.html'>Chapter 9 of HODV</a>, similar to the sample below.</p>

          <iframe title="Connecticut created desegregated schools for only 41 percent of Hartford Black &amp;amp; Latino students in 2019-20" aria-label="Interactive area chart" id="datawrapper-chart-fdcm0" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fdcm0/8/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

          <p>EDIT CAPTIONS like this -- Figure 1: Explore the <a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fdcm0/">interactive chart</a> AND ADD your description of the chart here. Make sure your caption includes a direct link to your published chart or map in case the embed code fails to display.</p>

          <h2>Methods</h2>

          <p>Create a separate section to describe how you obtained your data, key steps in your process, and cautions for interpreting its meaning. Write for an audience of future Trinity College students who may wish to replicate your steps. Write in HTML format and always include links to data sources, like this example from <a href='https://data.ct.gov'>CT Open Data</a>. Also link to your shared Google Sheets when appropriate.</p>

          <p>Give credit to people, organizations, resources, and tools that helped you to create this data story. Write in HTML format and include links when appropriate. When you paraphrase or quote from a specific reading, cite it using any standard academic citation style (such as MLA or APA inline citations), and include the full reference in a bibliography section at the end of your data story. For help with creating citations, I highly recommend the <a href='https://zbib.org'>Zbib.org</a> tool. Insert any URL, but you may need to click the Edit button to manually add missing details, such as author and date if the tool does not automatically recognize them, as shown in Image 1 and 2 below.</p>

          <img src="screenshots/sample-zbib1.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
          <p><i>Image 1: After inserting a URL into the ZBib.org tool, you may need to click the Edit button to manually add missing details.</i></p>

          <img src="screenshots/sample-zbib2.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
          <p><i>Image 2: Clicking the Edit button in ZBib allows you to enter or correct missing details, such as the full Website Title.</i></p>

          <p>Below are sample sentences with MLA inline citations that would appear in the body of the data story, followed by the full references that would appear in the bibliography at the bottom:</p>

          <h4>Sample sentences</h4>

          <p>The City of Hartford recently created a housing code that requires the registration of the full names and contact information for all owners of apartment buildings -- including the officers of Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) -- in order to "close municipal loopholes that allow anonymous slumlords to operate unchecked" (Lurye).</p>

          <p>In most towns, the percentage of high-needs students enrolled in traditional public schools surpasses those enrolled in magnet, charter, and technical schools in the most recent academic year (“Resident Town Export”).</p>

          <p>...later, insert a bibliography at the end of your data story:</p>

          <h4>Works Cited:</h4>

          <p>“Enrollment Report/Export (Legacy).” CT.Gov, <a href='https://public-edsight.ct.gov/students/enrollment-dashboard/enrollment-report-legacy.'>https://public-edsight.ct.gov/students/enrollment-dashboard/enrollment-report-legacy.</a>Accessed 2 Dec. 2025.</p>

          <p>“Resident Town Export.” CT.Gov EdSight, <a href='https://public-edsight.ct.gov/Overview/Resident-Town-Dashboard/Resident-Town-Export'>https://public-edsight.ct.gov/Overview/Resident-Town-Dashboard/Resident-Town-Export</a>. Accessed 29 Nov. 2022.</p>

          <br>

          <p>Optional Hint: To display a clickable web link in the bibliography, look at the HTML code in GitHub for the examples above. See how the URL appears twice: once in the "href" and again in the display text. This is not required for your data story, but it looks good and helps readers to click and view your sources.</p>
